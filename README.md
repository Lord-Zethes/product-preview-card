## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries

### What I learned

1. **Experience with Media Queries and Flexbox:** 
   I gained more experience working with media queries and flexbox layouts in this project. Setting up the layout to adjust between mobile and desktop views helped me understand responsive design better.

2. **Challenges with Spacing:** 
   One of the most challenging parts of the project was getting the spacing between elements to line up properly. I had to experiment with padding and margins to achieve the correct layout.

3. **Media Query for Switching Images:** 
   I used a `min-width` of 600px in my media queries to switch between the mobile and desktop images.

4. **Accessibility:** 
   I used semantic HTML tags and additional content for screen readers to ensure the component is accessible.

5. **Hover States:** 
   For hover states, I used simple CSS `:hover` effects to change the appearance of interactive elements, like buttons.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:
- Mastering media queries for responsive layouts
- Improving my understanding of CSS grid
- Enhancing accessibility features
